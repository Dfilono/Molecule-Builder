## Introduction

This project is under development and is a work in progress in its early stages. Please note that while it is available for basic use, bugs and errors are expected, as well as regular updates that may drastically change or break the current build.

## Current Features

- Generates molecules in a two basic shapes of a box or sphere
- Reads both XYZ and PDB files for initial input structures
- Can place solvent molecules surrounding a different solute molecule defined by a different input structure
- Can fill a volume, place a specified amount in a volume, or calculate the amount of molecules placed in a given volume based on density
- Molecules can be placed randomly or in a grid
- Writes data to an output file in XYZ or PDB formats

## Features in Progress

- Randomly reorient molecules in space to get closer to equilibrium position
- Generate structures based on meshes defined from outside software/packagaes such as Blender

## Documentation

A work in progress, documentation is currently unavailable at this time.
